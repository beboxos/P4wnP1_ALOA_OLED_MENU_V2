Installation instructions 
on boot partition edit config.txt to set I2C and SPI to active

nano /boot/config.txt
find the section far away down and set : 

dtparam=i2c_arm=on
dtparam=i2c1=on

and find and set spi section 

dtparam=spi=on


Note: 

-For the waveshare hat i used (and all gui.py is set like this) the inteface is SPI and not I2C
if you have a I2C oled edit gui.py file and set on line 72
USER_I2C = 1 #set to 1 if your oled is I2C


Note for SPI: (on gui.py)

-comment the "bus = smbus.SMBus(0)  # 0 = /dev/i2c-0 (port I2C0), 1 = /dev/i2c-1 (port I2C1)" line

-set USER_I2C=0

-(if you don't have a ups) set UPS=0
